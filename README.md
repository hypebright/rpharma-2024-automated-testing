## Example test repo

You can find the example test repo [here](https://github.com/hypebright/RPharmaTest). On this repo, there are two GitHub Actions running whenever there's a push to the `main` branch or a push on a pull request. The first action runs the tests and the second action checks the test coverage with `covr`.
