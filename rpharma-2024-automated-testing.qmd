# Hey 👋

Ready for a 10-minute crash course on automated testing with GitHub Actions?! ⚡️ 

# Why testing?

![testing meme](images/testing-meme.jpg)

# Why testing?

* Ensures code quality
* Reduces bugs
* Saves time
* Increases confidence in code changes

# How would you do it?

You have developed an R package and you want to test it. You would typically:

1. Write tests
2. Run tests with `devtools::test()`
3. Fix bugs
4. Repeat and push changes

Harsh reality: you will either skip 2 because you're too busy, or you will simply forget 2 (and 3) before pushing changes. 😬

# How would you do it?

You have developed an Shiny app and you want to test it. You would typically:

1. Manually test the app
2. Fix bugs
3. Repeat and push changes

Harsh reality: you're manual testing will become so annoying that you will skip 1 and 2 before pushing changes. 😬

# Work smarter, not harder!

Writing tests is just the first step. You need to automate the testing process to ensure that tests are run every time you push changes. Write tests once, enjoy them forever!

# What do you need?

* `testthat`
* `shinytest2` in the case of a Shiny app
* `covr` optionally, for checking test coverage
* GitHub Actions for automating the testing process

# testthat

# shinytest2

# covr

# GitHub Actions

Two workflows:

* R-CMD-check: checks the package, which includes running tests
* test-coverage: checks the test coverage

# Want to learn more?

* Check out GitHub for all the relevant files to get you started
* Open a discussion or issue on GitHub if you have any questions that weren't answered during this crash course
* Reach out to me on LinkedIn: [Veerle Eeftink - van Leemput](https://www.linkedin.com/in/veerlevanleemput/) (and while you there, give me a follow for weekly R and Shiny content! 🌟)
