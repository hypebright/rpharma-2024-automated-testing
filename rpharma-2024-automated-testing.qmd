# Hey 👋

Ready for a 10-minute crash course on automated testing with GitHub Actions?! ⚡️ 

# Why testing?

![Smooth bike ride in a test env](images/testing_meme2.jpeg)

# Why testing?

* Production is a dangerous place 💀
* Ensures code quality
* Reduces bugs
* Saves time
* Increases confidence in code changes

# How would you do it?

For an R package, you would typically:

1. Write tests
2. Run tests with `devtools::test()` or `devtools::check()` or `testthat::test_check()`
3. Fix bugs
4. Repeat and push changes

**Harsh reality**: you will either skip 2 because you're too busy, or you will simply forget 2 (and 3) before pushing changes. 😬

# How would you do it?

For a Shiny app, you would typically:

1. Manually test the app
2. Fix bugs
3. Repeat and push changes

**Harsh reality**: your manual testing will become so annoying that you will skip 1 and 2 before pushing changes. 😬

# Work smarter, not harder!

Write tests once, enjoy them forever! 🧡

# What do you need?

* An R package (see https://github.com/hypebright/RPharmaTest)
* `testthat`
* `usethis` to make your life easier
* GitHub Actions for automating the testing process

Optionally:

* `shinytest2` in the case of a Shiny app
* `covr` for checking test coverage

# R package

`R/take_break.R`

```r
#' Should you take a break?
#'
#' This function takes in three inputs and returns a logical value
#' indicating whether you should take a break.
#'
#' @param weather A character string indicating the weather.
#' @param time A numeric value indicating the time of day.
#' @param workload A numeric value indicating the amount of work you have.
#'
#' @examples
#' take_break(weather = "sunny", time = 10, workload = 3)
#'
#'
#' @return A logical value indicating whether you should take a break.
#'
#' @export

take_break <- function(weather, time, workload) {
  # check if weather is accepted value
  weather <- match.arg(weather, c("sunny", "cloudy", "rainy"))

  # time should be between 0 and 24
  if (time < 0 | time > 24) {
    stop("time should be between 0 and 24")
  }

  # workload should be numeric
  if (!is.numeric(workload)) {
    stop("workload should be numeric")
  }

  # determine whether or not to take a break
  if (weather == "sunny" & time > 10 & workload > 5) {
    return(TRUE)
  } else {
    return(FALSE)
  }
}
```

# R package

`inst/shiny/app.R`

```r
library(shiny)
library(RPharmaTest)

ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Should You Take a Break?"),
  selectInput("weather", "Weather:", choices = c("sunny", "cloudy", "rainy")),
  numericInput("time", "Time of day (0-24):", value = 12, min = 0, max = 24),
  numericInput("workload", "Workload (0-10):", value = 5),
  textOutput("result")
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  output$result <- renderText({
    if (take_break(input$weather, input$time, input$workload)) {
      "Yes, take a break!"
    } else {
      "No, keep working."
    }
  })
}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

# testthat

The basic **unit tests**. You need:

* testthat directory
* testthat files
* OR `usethis::use_testthat()` to create it all for you

# testthat

Project structure:

```plaintext
| tests
|--- testthat.R
|--- testthat
|   |--- test-take_break.R
```

# testthat

`tests/testthat/test-take_break.R`

```r
test_that("take_break returns correct values", {
  # Should return TRUE when it's sunny, after 10 AM, and workload > 5
  expect_true(take_break(weather = "sunny", time = 11, workload = 6))

  # Should return FALSE for other conditions
  expect_false(take_break(weather = "sunny", time = 9, workload = 6))
  expect_false(take_break(weather = "cloudy", time = 11, workload = 6))
  expect_false(take_break(weather = "sunny", time = 11, workload = 3))
})

test_that("take_break throws errors for invalid inputs", {
  expect_error(take_break("stormy", 11, 6))
  expect_error(take_break("sunny", -1, 6), "time should be between 0 and 24")
  expect_error(take_break("sunny", 11, "a lot"), "workload should be numeric")
})
```

# shinytest2

Project structure:

```plaintext
| tests
|--- testthat.R
|--- testthat
|   |--- test-take_break.R
|   |--- test-shiny.R
```

# shinytest2

`tests/testthat/test-shiny.R`

```r
library(shinytest2)

test_that("Shiny app works as expected", {

  # Don't run these tests on the CRAN build servers
  skip_on_cran()

  example_app <- system.file("shiny", package = "RPharmaTest")

  app <- AppDriver$new(app_dir = example_app,
                       name = "take-break-app")

  # Test when break should be taken
  app$set_inputs(weather = "sunny", time = 11, workload = 6)
  app$expect_text("#result")

  # Test when break should not be taken
  app$set_inputs(weather = "sunny", time = 9, workload = 6)
  app$expect_text("#result")
})
```

# covr

With `covr`, you can check the test coverage of your package. You can use the `covr` package to generate a test coverage report, which you can then use to improve your tests.

* `covr::package_coverage()` generates a test coverage report
* `covr::function_coverage()` calculates coverage for a specific function

# covr

![Well look at that!](images/package_coverage.png)

# Another additional step?!

So we have to run:

* `devtools::check()` OR
* `testthat::test_check()` for R CMD checks (including running tests) AND
* `covr::package_coverage()`

Every time?!


# 👋 Hello, GitHub Actions!

# GitHub Actions

With GitHub Actions, you can **automate** things ✨. You can create custom workflows that run every time you push changes to your repository. Handy!

# GitHub Actions

To run Actions, you create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repo. In here, you create `.yaml` files that define the workflows.

You can have one big workflow file, or you can split it up into **multiple workflow files**.

# GitHub Actions

Two workflow files:

* R-CMD-check: checks the package, which includes running tests
* test-coverage: checks the test coverage

# GitHub Actions

Two workflows files:

* R-CMD-check: `usethis::use_github_action("check-standard", badge = TRUE)`
* test-coverage: `usethis::use_github_action("test-coverage", badge = TRUE)`

# GitHub Actions

`.github/workflows/R-CMD-CHECK.yaml`

```yaml

# GitHub Actions

Every time you push changes to your repository, the workflows will run. You can see the results in the Actions tab in your repository.

<br>

And it can be a pass, or a fail... 🚦

# GitHub Actions

![Yay](images/github_actions_pass.png)

# GitHub Actions

![Oops](images/github_actions_fail.png)

# Showing off your efforts 💪

Badges. Show them off in your README. 

<br>

Bonus: remember the `badge = TRUE` argument in the `usethis::use_github_action()` function? This will automatically add the badge to your README!

# Showing off your efforts 💪

![](images/badges.png)

# Results 👏

* Forgetting to run tests is no excuse anymore
* You automatically get notified when a test fails (via email)
* You can always show QA that your code is X% covered by tests

# Want to learn more?

* Check out GitHub for all the relevant files to get you started
* Open a discussion or issue on GitHub if you have any questions that weren't answered during this crash course
* Reach out to me on LinkedIn: [Veerle Eeftink - van Leemput](https://www.linkedin.com/in/veerlevanleemput/) (and while you there, give me a follow for weekly R and Shiny content! 🌟)

# Enjoy the rest of the conference! 🎉
